v0.0.1

+ lexer is working in case of examples/import (compared to java version)

- fixed: CommonToken setCharPositionInLine method

- fixed: Lexer constructor
  from __construct($input, $state=null) to __construct($input, &$state=null)
  This looks like a typical potential error when one translates java to php.
